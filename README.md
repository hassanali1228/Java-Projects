# Java-Projects

Lots of interesting projects written with different skill levels, as I progressed in Java. They all create interesting visuals and experiment with user interaction.

Projects were made to encompass different cocepts in Java, for example:

1. OOP: creature_creation, particle system
2. Recursion: balloon_tree
3. Patterned randomization: grid_resampling
